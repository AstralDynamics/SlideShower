In order to stick to the good parts of JavaScript, we'll be using an eslint config setup to ignore all language constructs and standard library, other than ES6 Symbols, `with`, `do..for`, `let` and `Math.LOG2E`.

Going forward we'll be using the [Yay macro library](https://github.com/marcioAlmada/yay) so that we can transpile Elm into macroized PHP for the backend.
